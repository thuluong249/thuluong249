# About Me 👩‍💻
Since I moved to the US from Vietnam two years ago, I have had held two part-time jobs and in 2021 decided to return to my studies. I completed a bachelor’s degree in Banking and Finance in Vietnam, but as a student now, the most interesting thing is using my second language, English, in class. Upon taking up my studies again, I was nervous despite having previously worked in accounting, but I learned a lot. Overcoming this initial challenge of using my second language in a field I studied before, I decided to undertake a greater challenge and join University of Connecticut’s Certificate in Coding Course. <a href="https://bootcamp.uconn.edu/" rel="nofollow">Full Stack Web Development</a>. It has not been easy, but I am not turning back. I have decided to dedicate my energy to completing the Bootcamp, and I am giving it my best.
